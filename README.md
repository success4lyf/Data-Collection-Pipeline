# Data-Collection-Pipeline
An implementation of an industry grade data collection pipeline that runs scalably in the cloud.

## Step by Step Process

In this Data Collection pipeline project, I have collected tabular data and images from a website(https://www.boohoo.com). This data will be stored in a relational database and data lake in the cloud.

## Step 1: Selecting a Website

Being a lover of everything about fashion and beauty, there are three website i wanted to scrape:
1. https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk
2. https://www.boohoo.com
3. https://www.prettylittlething.com
